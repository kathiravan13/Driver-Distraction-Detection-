#  TITLE : Driver-Distraction-Detection

# Abstract

Driver distraction and drowsiness are major factors contributing to road accidents. This project presents a driver monitoring system that detects face tilt, yawning, drowsiness, and safe driving behavior using computer vision and deep learning techniques. A camera placed inside the vehicle captures real-time video of the driver’s face. Facial features and head movements are analyzed to identify face tilt, while mouth movements are monitored to detect yawning. Eye behavior and facial cues are used to determine the driver’s drowsiness level. Based on these observations, the system classifies the driver’s state as safe driving or unsafe driving. When drowsiness or distraction is detected, an alert can be generated to warn the driver. This system aims to enhance road safety by reducing accidents caused by driver fatigue and inattentive behavior.
